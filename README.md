# 🔴 Pokémon Button – A Mini Fun Project!

I just completed this creative mini-project during my batch at **Sheryians Coding School**, under the mentorship of **Sharthak sir**.

This interactive webpage combines fun visuals and simple logic using core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎮 Features & Functionality

- **Central "Click me!" Button**  
  When clicked, it spawns random Pokémon images at random screen positions, each with random rotation and size.

- **Pokémon Theme Song**  
  The background Pokémon theme song begins after the first interaction.

- **Volume Controls**  
  Two volume icons:
  - One to mute/unmute the music
  - Icon toggles dynamically based on the volume state

- **Pokémon-Themed UI**  
  - Clean, animated UI with themed backgrounds, shadows, and entrance animations
  - All images are dynamically created using DOM manipulation

- **Button Animations & Hover Effects**  
  - Interactive button animations
  - Subtle hover effects for enhanced UX
